In this tiny project, I've integrated LangGraph and utilized a few of its features. 🌟 There is a lot more to explore, and I plan to delve deeper into Agentic architecture. 🛠️

Future Updates for this Planner Agent:

📋 Fully functional Mermaid planning diagram, inspired by Claude.

🗓️ Integration with Google Calendar API to help professionals easily mark their dates just by writing.

🛠️ Building the UI.
